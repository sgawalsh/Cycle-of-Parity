# Cycle-of-Parity

This project was inspired by this (http://imgur.com/koVRHHf) post on imgur. Basically you can create a league, add teams, and assign wins to the teams. The program will then find a circle of parity in the league if it exists. Mine actually comes up with a different cycle then the one in the picture, but both are valid.
